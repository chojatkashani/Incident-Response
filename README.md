![NIST-SP-800-61-Process-Chart1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19b20c6e-67fe-4967-a2b5-a341cd5492f5)

## Overview
Incident response (IR) is a critical function in cybersecurity that determines how well an organization can withstand and recover from cyber threats. This project outlines a realistic and structured approach to developing and executing an Incident Response Plan (IRP), emphasizing real-world scenarios, stakeholder coordination, and technical execution. 

## Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive IRP tailored to organizational needs
- Conduct a simulated incident response drill
- Deploy automation to accelerate incident containment
- Improve forensic capabilities for post-incident analysis
- Establish a feedback loop to refine response strategies

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Defined Incident Response Team (IRT) with clear roles
- Security tools including SIEM, EDR, and SOAR platforms
- Playbooks for common attack scenarios
- Communication channels (e.g., Slack, email, emergency hotline)
- Legal and compliance considerations documented

## Incident Response Plan Structure
An effective IRP follows the **NIST 800-61** framework:

1. **Preparation:** Establish tools, resources, and response protocols.
2. **Detection & Analysis:** Identify suspicious activity and analyze the scope.
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery:** Neutralize threats and restore operations.
4. **Post-Incident Activity:** Review, document, and improve future responses.

## Implementation

### Scenario: Ransomware Attack Response
For this project, we simulate an **active ransomware attack** detected by an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system.

#### **Step 1: Detection & Analysis**
1. **SIEM Alert:**
   - Chronicle SIEM detects multiple failed logins and unauthorized encryption activities.
   - Logs indicate lateral movement from an admin workstation.
   - SOC analysts correlate activity with known ransomware TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

2. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Incident is assigned a severity level of **Critical**.
   - Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are extracted from logs and threat intelligence feeds.
   - Security team runs YARA-L rules to confirm malware presence.

#### **Step 2: Containment**
1. **Network Segmentation:**
   - Isolate infected machines using NAC (Network Access Control).
   - Disable compromised user accounts in Active Directory.

2. **Automated Threat Mitigation:**
   - SOAR platform triggers an automated playbook:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP
     ```
   - Blocks malicious IPs from further ingress.
   - Initiates memory dumps for forensic investigation.

#### **Step 3: Eradication & Recovery**
1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Reverse engineer the malware sample in a sandbox.
   - Identify initial entry vector (e.g., phishing email, RDP exploitation).

2. **System Restoration:**
   - Restore affected systems from **immutable backups**.
   - Apply additional hardening measures (e.g., disabling SMBv1, enforcing MFA).

#### **Step 4: Post-Incident Review**
1. **Debrief with Stakeholders:**
   - Hold a post-mortem with security, IT, and legal teams.
   - Assess whether regulatory reporting (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is required.

2. **Policy Updates:**
   - Update response playbooks to address any gaps.
   - Implement continuous security awareness training.


This project provided a structured and realistic approach to incident response, focusing on **real-world execution** rather than theoretical guidelines. By integrating automation, forensic analysis, and stakeholder coordination, the IR process was **both efficient and effective**. Future enhancements include integrating **AI-driven threat detection** and **zero-trust architecture** to minimize breach impact.

A well-executed IRP ensures that organizations not only **survive attacks** but **emerge stronger** with refined defenses and improved resilience.
